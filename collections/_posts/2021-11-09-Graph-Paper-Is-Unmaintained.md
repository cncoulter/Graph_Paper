Graph Paper was a good project for me. Working on this project taught me about HTML, Jekyll, RSS feeds, and Bootstrap. But I'm done with this project now, and I will no longer maintain or update it.

Now, if you want to fork Graph Paper to set up your own website, you're still welcome to do so. I hope it's helpful! You might want to consider updating Bootstrap to a newer version.

Even if you don't want to fork Graph Paper, I think this project can still stand as a great reference for how to do cool things in Jekyll, like support Twitter cards, paginate your blog, and create custom RSS feeds.

## Why?

I've learned a lot about web design and accessibility in the last year. I've come to really appreciate the simple power of Flexbox, Grid, and [intrinsic web design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBwBACbRuGY). I have different standards for what good and accessible code looks like, and I've come to value vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript over frameworks. Put all that together and frankly, I'm just not interested in using Bootstrap anymore.

I still like *the idea* of Graph Paper: a Jekyll website that I can quickly fork and use to set up a new site with. Sometime in the future, I may cycle back and create a Graph Paper 2.0: a website base with higher accessibility and design standards, written in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Want to Take Over?

I'm also abandoning this project because, as far as I'm aware, this project hasn't been useful to anyone else. If I'm mistaken, if you appreciate Graph Paper, you're welcome to take over as maintainer.

If you want to update Graph Paper --- to add new features or update to a newer version of Bootstrap --- great! Fork Graph Paper (you're welcome to keep the name or change it), and let me know. I'll add a new blog post here pointing over to your site.
